#Budget Tracker

Budget Tracker is a web based application that I building. Once complete
tha tracker will allow the user to track their income and expenditure, view their income or
expenditures in a chart, pie chart, bar chart, etc, track their own expenditure or income history,
view or download it in a pdf format, etc. The application
will also has a saving estimator where it will operate in two ways

First way it allows you to see the amount you need to save to reach a goal target:

How it works?

       1. You enter the target goal amount e.g. 2000
       2, Select the start and end date. This will be the number weeks you will be saving
       3. Enter the frequency you want to add the money by, example daily, weekly, monthly or yearly

Once done the Tracker will tell you whether based on the amount you entering and the numbers whether you will reach
your target

The second way:

How it works?

    1. Enter the target goal amount
    2. Select the start and end date
    3. Tracker will automatically tell you how much you need to put aside to reach your goal



So, far I built only a couple of page couple of pages for the front end using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. The design
of the pages are not the final design and will be subjected to change but for now I built a skeleton of the pages.
 
The front pages using a lot of Javascript for the front end but the backend will use python

##Todo
    1.Build the backend using Python
    2.Build the rest of the front end
    3. Complete the saving estimator
    4. Finish the frontend design as well as the pages
